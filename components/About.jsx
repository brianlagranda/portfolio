        From my early days, I&apos;ve loved unraveling puzzles—whether in games
        or daily challenges. After a hiatus, I rediscovered my passion for
        coding two years ago, delving into web development. Thanks to my dad,
        who initially sparked this interest during my childhood. When I&apos;m
        not immersed in coding or tweaking a frontend masterpiece, you&apos;ll
        find me dropping beats as Deejay, battling virtual foes in video games,
        or hitting the pavement for a refreshing run, a hobby I recently picked
        up. I&apos;ve also discovered sweet parallels between coding and cooking
        desserts—a perfect blend of precision and creativity. Life&apos;s a
        game, and I&apos;m here to make it more enjoyable through frontend
        development, beats, and the perfect recipe for success!
